Just walked out of the theater, and my head's still spinning from Alarum. I'm dragging my feet, barely awake, yet there's this electric buzz stuck in my brain. What the heck was that fever dream? I mean, let's be real: who thought mixing a suspense thriller with existential musings was a sane idea? But here we are, folks. Somehow feeling like I've just walked out of therapy, but instead of serene calmness, there's a curious mix of “Did that just happen?” and mild irritation. 

You know that feeling when you're getting a massage, and the therapist hits a knot you didn't even know you had? That’s what the opening scene was like—sneaky and kind of uncomfortable, but you can't deny it makes you feel... something. And could we talk about the cinematography? It's like they dunked the camera in a vat of dream juice and said, “Yep, that'll do.” Can I just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into my subconscious for further contemplation? Not sure it'd help, but my brain refuses to let it go. 

> But, oh, the character development. It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat chasing a laser pointer, never really catching it, but totally obsessed. I'm fully convinced the scriptwriters just tossed their notes into a blender and went with the results. A conversation about the nature of time somehow spiraled into a car chase, and I’m here for it—even though my left eye started twitching in disbelief. 

And don’t get me started on the sound design, an absolute trip. It felt like the technicians were trying to massage my eardrums whether I wanted it or not. A surprise, honestly, especially in those scenes when you're totally unprepared and snack on the decibels like they’re popcorn. It almost felt like the sound was another character—a sassy sidekick who knows more than the hero. 

string[] existentialCrisis = { Why am I here?, What is time?, Pass the popcorn, please. };

Really strange to think I went in for a casual night out and left contemplating the nature of reality itself—who has the energy for that on a Tuesday night? Halfway through, I was like, “Yep, I’ll have nightmares or epiphanies later, whichever comes first.” Definitely worth a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 if you enjoy wrestling with your own sanity for a couple of hours. Though maybe stand-by with a comfort   post-binge, just to ease you back into the realms of coherence.
